Agentic RAG means an AI agent that can decide when to use tools.
It can search in a local knowledge base and also use web search tools.

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) helps the model answer using real documents.
The model first retrieves relevant text, then reads it, and then writes the final answer.

A retriever is a component that finds the most relevant text chunks using embeddings.
It does not generate text, it only selects useful information.

Vector embeddings turn text into numbers so similar texts are close to each other.
FAISS is a vector database used to store and search these embeddings efficiently.

Using sources is important to reduce hallucinations.
Good RAG systems always show where the information comes from.
